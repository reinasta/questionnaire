<!-- This is part of research in philosophy of language and linguistics conducted by Andrei Nasta at University of East Anglia. See my homepage for more details. No approval by the University has been sought, and the University does not necessarily endorse the present study.  -->

*This linguistic experiment is about English sentences as understood by native speakers of English. Non-native speakers, even if perfectly fluent, should not participate in the experiment. A native speaker of English is someone (1) who was raised from birth until at least age 13 in an English speaking country where the primary language was English, and (2) who spoke English to their parents during those years.* 

#### About the experiment {#about .unnumbered}

This is a linguistic experiment consisting of a questionnaire (survey), preceded by a list of instructions which explain how to complete the questionnaire. The questionnaire contains 42 sentences that must be evaluated or ranked by native speakers of English. You are paid $3 for reading the instructions and completing the questionnaire, which takes about 20 minutes overall. Please read the instructions carefully. 
  

### What to do and how to do it? {#what-how .unnumbered}

#### Task {#task .unnumbered}

Each of the tasks involves a little *story* and one or more corresponding *sentences*. To do the tasks, make sure you: 

1. understand the little story
2. understand the sentences coming after the story, including the possible ways of interpreting these sentences
3. evaluate the sentences in the context of the story, that is, *rank each sentence on a scale from 1-7 according to its compatibility with the story*. 

<!-- Note that these sentences may be inappropriate under one or more interpretations. We are interested in the *most* appropriate interpretation (in context), and we want to ask how appropriate that interpretation sounds to you on a scale from 1-7. -->

<!-- Note also that special intonation might be needed in order to evaluate the sentence, so we recommend reading them out loud if they seem inappropriate on the first reading.  -->

#### Ranking of sentences {#ranking .unnumbered}

The ranking of sentences is the essential part of the experiment. The worst sentences are ranked 1 and the perfectly good ones are ranked 7. Of course, you may use any other number between 1-7 to rank the sentences, according to how bad/good a sentence appears to be. The higher the number, the better the sentence!


#### Examples of stories and sentences {#examples .unnumbered}

To give you an idea about how to rank sentences, here are several examples of very bad and very good sentences in the context of specific little stories. 

**Typographical conventions** The story is written in normal font. The sentences to be evaluated are written in `monospaced font`. 
To draw your attention to a particular expression in a sentence we will wrap the expression in stars, like so: \*`expression`\*. 
Our few comments and guidelines are displayed in *italic fonts*. 

**Example 1** John likes fishing and in the last vacation he went fishing in three different creeks (creek~1~, creek~2~, and creek~3~). He caught three fish: one in creek~1~, another one in creek~2~, and yet another one in creek~3~. *So, are the following proper ways of describing the situation?*

(@ref1-1) `John caught a fish in three creeks.` [1]  <!-- @matthewson2004 [407]-->
(@ref1-2) `John caught a fish in each creek.` [7]

*Note: Evaluate a sentence **only** in its context, that is, as part of the little story. Take sentence (@ref1-1):* "`John caught a fish in three creeks`". *If you interpret sentence (@ref1-1) outside its context, it will be good from a grammatical point of view (albeit implausible, because it implies that John caught the very same fish in each of the creeks). But in the context of the story, it is really bad because the story tells us that John caught three fish (not just one, as sentence (@ref1-1) implies). So sentence (@ref1-1) receives grade [1]. On the other hand, sentence (@ref1-2) is very good and fits perfectly well the context, and so gets the highest grade, [7].* 

*We should say that the evaluation of sentences is **flexible**: some people will feel that they want to give a [2] to sentence (@ref1-1) and a [6] to sentence (@ref1-2). That's all right! What's unacceptable for most native speakers of English is to rank (@ref1-1) above (@ref1-2).*

*Also, note that (@ref1-2) is considered perfectly good even if it's not as explicit as it could be: it says that John caught a fish in each creek, leaving it implicit that it is about each of the \*three\* creeks mentioned in the story. So we are not interested in how comprehensive the information conveyed by a sentence is, but only in its degree of compatibility with the context, assuming it is not altogether misleading. As long as the sentence is compatible with the context, and the information it conveys is not misleading, it should be as good as a more explicit or comprehensive sentence (compatible with the context).*

**Example 2** Suppose Lena knows that Pam likes one and only one person, namely Pam (herself). To describe what she knows, Lena says just the following (and does nothing else to express what she knows). *Evaluate how good Lena's assertions are.*

(@ref2-1) `She likes Pam.` [1]
(@ref2-2) `Pam likes herself.` [7]

*Note: the sentence* "`She likes Pam`" *(@ref2-1) is good in itself, but here we are interested in whether the sentence is compatible with what the little story (context) tells us. If we consider the context (as we always should!), the sentence becomes bad, because it suggests that some other person than Pam likes Pam. So it receives grade [1]. On the other hand, sentence (@ref2-2) is very good because it fits very well with the context, and gets a [7]. (As with the previous example, slightly different evaluations are possible.)*

*Once again, neither sentence is as explicit (or informative) as it could be. The sentences would convey the complete information in the story if we were to say, for example, that Pam likes \*only\* herself. However, the fact that our sentences are not fully explicit is not in itself a reason to consider them bad.*

**Bottom-line** Each sentence is preceded by a little story. Always evaluate sentences in the context of the given story. The evaluation is somewhat flexible. However, do not hesitate to give 7s and 1s if the sentences do (or don't) make sense to you in their context. Finally, it's not important whether the sentences are fully informative. What really matters is the compatibility of the sentences with the story/context, provided that they are not misleading in that context.  

#### Key guidelines for evaluation {#key-guides .unnumbered}

+ we are *not* interested in whether these sentences would be graded highly by a writing teacher, or whether they mesh with the rules of grammar you learned in school. 
+ *nor* do we care about the style or clarity of the sentences, or about their being fully informative. We are interested only in whether you think that these sentences are informative enough and sound right to you in their contexts.     
+ we are interested in the evaluation of each sentence on its own, rather than in whether there are better alternative ways of saying the same thing. So if you have to evaluate a sentence S, we want you to judge how good S is (in its context), rather than how good S is compared to another sentence S' (that might be used in the same context).  
+ finally, this experiment is not designed to be a memory test or any other way of measuring your abilities. So just tell us if you find the sentences acceptable in regular conversation.

### The questionnaire {#questionnaire .unnumbered}

*Please evaluate the following sentences in the context of their stories.*

**Story 1** Some time ago, John had to meet my students, but he was not able to do so because he was sick. The students didn't get to meet John. *Do the following express well what happened in the story?* 

(@24) `John didn't meet every student of mine.`
(@24-1) `John didn't meet all my students.` 

**Story 2** The wax museum is a famous museum that showcases wax statues of celebrities, statues that look exactly like the celebrities they portray. Ringo Starr (from the Beatles) went to the wax museum and saw his statue, which looked exactly like him. He was very impressed with the statue. *Suppose that someone in a group of friends who all know the story utters the following sentence. Would that sentence be appropriate?*

(@f1) `Ringo considered himself very impressive.` <!-- (56) b. -->

**Story 3** Yesterday, John was able to come to meet my students, and he did. However, several students were not able to make it, and they didn't show up to the meeting. *How good are the following sentences?*  

(@25) `Every student of mine didn't show up.` 
(@25-1) `All my students didn't show up.` 

**Story 4** Sue and Pam are talking about a friend of theirs, Oscar, who's known to be very self-confident. *How good are Pam's answers below?* <!-- (given that she has Oscar in mind when she uses the words *him* and *himself*) -->

(@f2) Sue: Oscar trusts nobody. — Pam: `Not exactly, Oscar trusts *him*`. <!-- (57)a -->
(@f2-1) Sue: Oscar trusts nobody. — Pam: `Not exactly, Oscar trusts *himself*`.
 

**Story 5** Bill the doctor had to see the students after John met them. But the students were too tired after the meeting with John, and didn't show up at the meeting with Bill. So Bill didn't get to see the students. *Is this situation correctly depicted by the following sentence?* 

(@27) `One student didn't show up to meet Bill.` 


**Story 6** Suppose you want to say that everyone hates Lucifer, except Lucifer himself. *How good are the following ways of expressing this idea about Lucifer?*

(@f3-1) Everybody hates Lucifer. `Only he (himself) likes him.`  <!-- (57)c -->
(@f3-2) Everybody hates Lucifer. `Only he likes himself.`


**Story 7** On each floor of the university building A, there are many windows (say 23). On each day of the week, someone opens the windows on one---and only one---floor. *Is the following the right thing to say?*

(@28a) `Many windows are always open in this building.` 

**Story 8** Pam discovered that three of her colleagues have something in common, and wants to share that with her friend. She starts by saying ```You know what Mary, Sue and John have in common?`'' and then goes on as shown in (@f4-1) and (@f4-2). 

(@f4-1)  `Mary admires John, Sue admires him, and John admires *him* too.` <!-- (57)e -->
(@f4-2)  `Mary admires John, Sue admires him, and John admires *himself* too.` 

*How good are these sentences?* *Note that the only difference between the two sentences is that (@f4-1) has* `him` *as penultimate word, whereas (@f4-2) has* `himself`.

**Story 9** On each floor of the university building B, there are very few windows (say 3). On each day of the week, someone opens the windows on one---and only one---floor. *Is the following sentence right in this context?*

(@28b) `Few windows are always open in this building.` 

**Story 10** Suppose John thinks that stories where a person (any person) destroys another person are amusing, but doesn't like stories in which persons destroy themselves. So, for instance, if, say, Mary destroys Oscar, that's ok with John, but if Mary destroys herself, that's not ok. *How well would the following sentences represent John's thought?* 

(@f5-1) `Stories about the destruction of oneself can be amusing.` <!-- (65) -->
(@f5-2) `Self-destruction stories can be amusing.` <!-- (66) -->

**Story 11** Let's imagine that the twelve apostles had a very small number of things which were common property; that is, the apostles shared a very low number of things (say three silver coins).  *Are the following assertions right?*

(@33) `Every apostle had few things.` 
(@33-0) `All apostles had few things.` 

**Story 12** John had a weird dream in which he was Jesus. In the dream, Jesus forgives the sins of several people, including even John's sins. *How well do the following sentences express how things stand in John's dream?* 

(@f6-1) `John dreamt he was Jesus and forgave himself all his sins.` <!-- (75) -->
(@f6-2) `John dreamt he was Jesus. Then John-Jesus forgave himself (John) all his sins.`

**Story 13** Leah meets her friends to have a drink. Talking about movies, she notices that everyone saw *The Hobbit*, *Interstellar* and *The Imitation Game*, although some of her friends saw other movies as well. Let's assume that *few* here means about 3 but no more than 6. In other words, anyone seeing three movies counts as seeing *few* movies. In talking about her friends, Leah says (@33-1) and (@33-2). *Are the two sentences appropriate in this context?*

(@33-1) `Everyone saw few movies.` 
(@33-2) `All of us saw few movies.` 

**Story 14:** Suppose John wants to say something about Oscar, namely, that Oscar was tricked by a lawyer, but John wants to say that without using the name "Oscar" twice (or the pronoun "he"). So John comes up with three other expressions (which we emphasise like so: \*expression\*). *Evaluate how good these expressions are given that they are meant to refer to Oscar.*

(@f7-1) `Oscar paid the lawyer who tried to trick *the idiot*.` 
(@f7-2) `Oscar paid the lawyer who tried to trick *the nice guy*.` 
(@f7-3) `Oscar paid the lawyer who tried to trick *the tallest man around*.` 

<!-- 
Mrs McCain had a weird dream in which she is a person who is actually identical with Palin. In the dream, that person convinces Palin to vote for herself. *How well do the following represent McCain's dream?* 

(@f7-1) `Mrs McCain dreamt she was Palin and that she (McCain) convinced her (Palin) to vote for herself (Palin).`  (79b)
(@f7-2) `Mrs McCain dreamt she was Palin and that she (McCain-Palin) convinced herself to vote for her (Palin).`  (similar (79b), with a reflexive instead of a pronoun in the second position)
 -->

**Story 15** We know that, within an army, a certain group of military persons (for instance, cadets, lieutenants, colonels, or majors) have been given few days off, and the rest of them have had plenty of days off. It turns out that cadets (with no exception) were the only ones given exactly 2 days off. Let's assume that 2 days is the minimum free time that a military person can get. Then, someone reports the situation as follows.   

(@33-3) `Few days were free for every cadet.`  
(@33-4) `Every cadet got few days off.` 

*Evaluate if these reports are good.*  *Note that* `few` *rather than* `a few` *is used in each sentence*.  

<!-- Note that the context does not contain direct info on whether the specific group of military persons had the same days off. --> 

**Story 16** Suppose Max voted for Max (himself), but nobody else voted for Max. *Say how good the following sentences are.* 

(@8-1) `Only Max himself voted for him.` <!-- Roelofsen 2010, (9), p. 118 -->
(@8-2) `Only Max voted for him.`
(@8-3) `Only Max voted for himself.` 


<!-- **Story 16** Max, John and several other people stand in the election of the leader for a well-known company. 
Max voted for Max (himself), John voted John (himself), and nobody else voted for Max or John. How good do the following sentence sound to you?-->

**Story 17** In a firm the employees have only three days off: Christmas day, Easter, and the 1st of January. Let's take for granted that in terms of yearly holiday time few days means fewer than 7 days. *Is the following the right thing to say in this situation?* 

(@33-5) `Everyone in the firm got few days off.` 

**Story 18** Max voted for Max, but nobody else voted for themselves. *How good are the following?* 

(@8-1) `Only Max himself voted for him.` <!-- Roelofsen 2010, (9), p. 118 -->
(@8-2) `Only Max voted for himself.` 

<!-- Paraphrase: there are few days such that everyone is free on each of these days. Untested bit: but there may be other different days off for each employee. This is unnecessary, since it's an additional piece of information! -->

**Story 19** Suppose we are talking about cities in Doklessania, an imaginary country where in each city there are three doctors. *Is the following the right thing to say about Doklessania (assuming that three is few)?*

(@28b-1) `Few doctors live in every city.` 
(@28b-2) `Every city has/accommodates fewer than five doctors.`  
(@28b-5) `Fewer than five doctors live in every city.` 
(@28b-4) `Few persons in every city are doctors.`
(@28b-3) `Three persons in every city are doctors.`

<!-- NB: The inverse scope reading of downward entailing operators seems more accessible with *less than* or *fewer than*-expressions: Everyone listened to less than three tunes/cf. few/fewer than three.  -->


*Congratulation, you're almost done! Please take a moment to make sure that you ranked all of the sentences.*
